            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

One</hi> Haxstoun <hi>of</hi> Rachillet <hi>being one of these Creditors, and at that time a Favorite of the Archbishops, prevails with him, upon his giving Bond to the Bishop for</hi> 1000 l. Scots, <hi>or thereby, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign the gift in his Favours. Thereafter the Archbishop conceiving prejudice against him, Registrates</hi> Haxstouns <hi>Bond, surprises him at St.</hi> Andrews; <hi>having called for him, takes him with Caption, and keeps him Prisoner in St.</hi> Andrews <hi>for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Months, until one Mr.</hi> Falconer <hi>a Conform Minister obtains his liberty. But</hi> Haxstoun <hi>having stronger resentments of his Imprisonment, than of the liberty to which he was restored, at his liberation in presence of witnesses, Vowed and Swore,</hi> God-dam-him if ever he went to Church as long as there was a Bishop in <hi>Scotland;</hi> And that if he lived he should be revenged on the Bishops person.</p>

                           <hi>This</hi> Haxstoun <hi>was a vile person, had nothing of good in him, and was scarce admitted to the Society of Sober-men; He was not once only a Favourite, but Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Bishop, having Collected part of his Rents.</hi>

            <p>The falshood hereof appears manifestly malicious, in so far as <hi>Haxstoun</hi> of <hi>Rachillet</hi> was so far from having been either Servant or Favourite to my Lord Arch-Bishop, that he was a man altogether unknown to his Grace, in so much as he had never spoken with him in all his life before the time, he out of pure charity to <hi>Lovel</hi> of <hi>Cunuchies</hi> Children (whose Tutor this <hi>Haxstoun</hi> was left by the Father, in regard of his near relation) made a transaction and agreement with him in favours of the said Children, which agreement is dat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>February,</hi> 1677. and so favourable and charitable was my Lord Primat to the poor Children, that not only did he authorize <hi>Haxstoun</hi> their Cousin, to mannage and uplift the Rents of <hi>Cunuchie,</hi> (which by a Decreet and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Judges were due to his Grace) that thereby he might have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to be helpful to them, but gave them an yearly allowance for their subsistance and maintenance; When <hi>Haxstoun</hi> had uplifted an years Rent thereof, and disposed on it, he was so far from being rigid to him, that he condescended to take his Bond, to pay at the expyring of three quarters of a year, what was presently due: The time of payment being come, <hi>Haxstoun</hi> still delayes to fulfil his obligation, though frequently minded of it by my Lords Factor, who finding nothing but delayes and shifts, did registrate the Bond on the ninth of <hi>January,</hi> 1678. And on the twelth of <hi>March</hi> thereafter, while the Arch-bishop was in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and without his Graces knowledge, <hi>Hax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoun</hi> was, by a Messenger of Arms, apprehended in the Town of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and after his positive declining to give any manner of satisfaction, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Prison by order of Law; of which, when the Arch-bishop had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, he would not have given way to it, had he not been credibly informed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:174874:4"/>and assured, that the Money arising by the sale of the Corns, had been dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of by <hi>Rathillet</hi> to <hi>Kinloch,</hi> and made use of by him, for buying Horse and Arms, for his keeping of rebellious field Conventicles. <hi>Rathillets</hi> agreement, his intromission and stated Account are still exstant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his own hand, to satisfie any who desire to see them. <hi>Haxstoun</hi> having continued some time in Prison; Dr. <hi>Falconer</hi> being his Cousin-German, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated his liberation, and having ingaged for the sum due to the Arch-bishop, obtained it: and the Doctor declareth, that being present at his enlargement, he heard him express none of these desperate words abovementioned, either as to his deserting the Church; nor utter any terrible imprecations to be aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on the Lord Arch-bishops person. This now clearly discovers the villany and malice of the Author of this infamous Libel, so far as relates to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of <hi>Haxstoun</hi> of <hi>Rathillet,</hi> and the falshood of these malicious insinuations suggested by him, as if the Lord Arch-bishop had been an oppressor of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans, and that by the rigorous usage of the former, he had provock'd him to a revenge so sacrilegious and execrable.</p>

And so before it can be supposed that the Arch-bishop could have any malice or enmity against <hi>Balfour</hi> of <hi>Kinloch,</hi> upon the accompt of his relation to <hi>Haxstoun</hi> of <hi>Rathillet.</hi> 2. <hi>That this</hi> Balfour <hi>should be no Presbyterian;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he is one of the Zealots of that party, and greatest leaders of field Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles, and at this present a chief Officer, or Commander among the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels who have proclaimed the Covenant at <hi>Rutherglen.</hi> 3. <hi>That one</hi> Scarlet <hi>a Tinker, should have been with Captain</hi> Carstairs <hi>at the encounter with</hi> Balfour; whereas it is notour, that this fellow was one of <hi>Welshes</hi> Guard, and would neither have undertaken, nor have been trusted in any such interprise: and is now in prison, and to be arraigned for this Treasonable Crime of guarding and assisting a declared Traitor. 4. <hi>That</hi> Carstairs <hi>had no Warrand to apprehend this</hi> Balfour; it being apparent that he had an express Order for that effect fom the Privy Council. 5. <hi>That this</hi> Balfour <hi>was denunced and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercommuned for the deforcement of</hi> Carstairs; whereas he was declared fugitive, and intercommuned several years before that violence was committed.</p>

            <p>As for the robbing and spoiling pretended to be committed by Bailiff <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>michael, the Secret Councils Sheriff-depute,</hi> &amp;c. It is sad to see what shifts malice will contrive, to justifie even the most sacrilegious and bloody Crimes; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a strange inference, suppose it were true, that Bailiff <hi>Carmichael</hi> had done ill things in <hi>Fife,</hi> that therefore their rage against him should have provoked them to so horrid and barbarous a murther of any other person. 2. Bailiff <hi>Carmichael</hi> being deputed by the Sheriff-principal of <hi>Fife,</hi> to execute the Laws against keepers of Field-conventicles, and other disorderly persons in <hi>Fife,</hi> did neither rob nor spoil, but proceeded in a legal and moderat manner, in sentencing and fining according to Law, such as were cited before the Sheriff-court, according to very considerat and legal Instructions he had received from the Privy Council for that effect. Nor doth it appear, that any of the bloody Murderers of the Lord Archbishop, were ever so much as cited before
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:174874:6"/>the said Depute, much less fined by him; So that this pretence for so bloody a villany, is altogether vain, groundless and frivolous.</p>
            <p>As to what is said of his Body, being hit with several Shots, but not pierced thereby, and that they left <hi>only blunt marks somewhat like unto burning;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Author in a most hellish manner insinuats, that the Body of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated person was hard and proof of shot, and whereby he commits a more villanous murder upon the fame and character of the Martyr, then the bloody Assassines did upon his person: The falshood of this is apparent, from the subscribed Testimony of a Doctor of Medicine, and of three Chyrurgions, produced before the Privy Council, and still exstant in the hands of the Clerks thereof (whereof <hi>William Borthwick</hi> is one, and the principal) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is attested and declared, that among his many other wounds, that he received one, two or three inches below the right Clavicle, in betwixt the second and third Rib, by a shot.</p>
            <p>It shall be unnecessary to say any more of the other manifest and bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced lies contained in the foresaid Paper, such as that <hi>the murderers hurt none of his servants, except the Postilion;</hi> whereas the best armed of his servants was wounded in the head by a sword, and his Daughter, besides the wound of her Thumb, had another in her Thigh; and that <hi>they dragged him out of his Coach,</hi> whereas indeed he very composedly opened the door of the Coach himself, and with meekness and resolution stept out, and went forward to the murderers, who were, with so Grave and Reverend a Presence and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, so much stunn'd and amazed, that they looked upon one another, and stood a little while like men confounded, and unresolved what to do: Since enough is said to discover this infamous Libel to be a congestion of lies and malicious untruths heaped together, upon design to vindicat the fanatick Party, and keepers of Field-Conventicles, from the guilt of that sacred and innocent blood; as if nothing but privat picque or revenge had provoked the barbarous Assassines to this nefarious Murder; whereas the Actors thereof are all known to have been Presbyterian Zealots, bigot Fanaticks, and constant frequenters of Field-Conventicles, and are now in Armes, and some of them prime Officers and Leaders in the present Rebellion against the King and the Government: Which Insurrection is made upon design to overthrow the Monarchy, and the present Government of this Church, and to model both according to the Covenant.</p>

                  <p>THe Paper you sent me, under the Title of, <hi>A true Relation of what is discovered concerning the murder of the Archbishop of St.</hi> Andrews, <hi>and of what appears to have been the occasion thereof;</hi> contains so many gross and notorious lyes, published upon the most malicious design, that it is no wonder you are greatly troubled thereat. My Relation to <hi>Lovel</hi> of <hi>Cunuchie,</hi> and <hi>Haxstoun</hi> of <hi>Rathillet</hi> (being the nearest save that of a Brother) as it moved my Lord Archbishop to make me privy to his transactions with both, so it gives you just ground to expect from me a faithful and true account thereof, which I do impartially give you, upon certain knowledge, in the following Narrative.</p>
                  <p>At the time of <hi>Lovel</hi> of <hi>Cunuchie</hi> his decease, a considerable Sum, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>4</hi> and <hi>5000</hi> Merk, was owing by him to my Lord Archbishop, for the Fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duty of his Lands that for many years had not been payed (my Lord forbearing him in his life time, out of pity, because of his incumbred estate, and out of a personal kindness to himself) My Lord Archbishop, being by Law preferred to all other Creditors, was to have the Rent of the Lands ay and while he should be payed, and therefore gave order to <hi>Cunuchie</hi>'s own Servants to labour and sow the Land that year he died, as formerly; after which he gave a gift of his Escheat, comprehending the Corns that were left after the Seed, with the Cattel and whole furniture of the House, (which might have been claimed by my Lord, though he had been no Creditor, as Superiour of the Lands) to a confident Person, who was to have made Money of them for the behoof of the Children. This Donator of the Escheat, was, by my Lords order, to assign his Gift to the said <hi>Haxstoun</hi> of <hi>Rathillet,</hi> (a man altogether unknown to my Lord, and so far from being a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite or Servant, that he had never spoke with him in his life before that time) he oblieging himself, that after payment of that Creditor, at whose instance <hi>Lovel</hi> of <hi>Cunuchie</hi> was denounced Rebel, he should imploy the remainder of what Money he could make thereof, for the relief of the Children: The truth of this can be made appear, to any that will desire to be satisfied therein, by a Paper exstant, signed by <hi>Rathillet</hi>'s own hand; and that <hi>Rathillet</hi> did actually dispose of these Goods, and uplift the Money and prices of them, can also be made appear by a stated Account of his Intromission, signed also by his own Hand, to be shown to any that has a mind, by my Lords Factor. The reasons why this Trust was given to <hi>Rathillet,</hi> were, his near relation to the Children, his being nominated their Tutor by their Father, his many protestations to be faithful in it, and importunity upon these grounds to have it. The first years Crop that should have been uplifted for my Lords payment, was sold to <hi>Haxstoun,</hi> at the easiest rate of the Countrey, on purpose, that he taking the opportunity of selling the Corn at the best avail, might have something after the price that was to be payed to my Lord, to bestow upon the Children: However, all that my Lord received for that years Rent, was <hi>Rathillet</hi>'s Bond for between eleven and twelve hundred pound Scots, to be payed three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a year after the Term at which the Rent was payable. The time of payment being come, before which <hi>Rathillet</hi> had sold all the Corn, he nevertheless fulfilled not his Obligation, and giving nothing but fair excuses for what was past, and peremptor promises of speedy payment at dyets, which he always deserted; he eluded the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Law for near four Months, while at last he was apprehended by a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:174874:7"/>in St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> by order from one of my Lords servants, my Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self knowing nothing thereof, as being then at <hi>Edinburgh:</hi> All that day he was kept in a private House, and offer was made to him, if he would pay presently any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable part of the Sum, which (as my Lords Factor averred) he had faithfully promised he should have brought with him the day before, or give a Precept for so much upon any honest responsible Men, who had bought the Victual, it should be accepted in part of payment, and discharged accordingly; he himself be set at liberty, and a further time granted him for the payment of the rest: both which he shifted and declined; whereupon at night he was committed to the publick Prison, where he lay for some time, until I became Debitour to my Lord for the Sum, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured his inlargement: At which-time, neither I, nor any person that was with him at his coming out of Prison, heard any thing of the desperate resolution, either to desert the Church, or be revenged on the Archbishops person, alledged (by the Author of the Paper) to have been expressed by him, with a terrible imprecation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Witnesses. After this, my Lord hearing of the straitned condition of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ordered by his Precept the Tenant of <hi>Cunuchie</hi> to deliver for the Childrens use twenty Bolls of Victual, and thereafter signed a Paper with the other Creditors, some of whom he moved to condescend thereto, and to all whom he gave the example, being the first Subscriber for a yearly allowance to them.</p>
                  <p>By what hath been said, the falshood of that Paper, and the malice of its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, is clearly discovered, as to that part of it which relates to <hi>Haxstoun,</hi> and how groundless the insinuations are of the Archbishops uncharitable oppression of <hi>Cunu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie</hi>'s Family, or Creditors, his rigorous usage of <hi>Haxstoun,</hi> and provoking of him thereby to so execrable a revenge by that horrid murder.</p>
                  <p>As to what is reported in the Paper of <hi>John Balfour</hi> of <hi>Kinloch,</hi> Brother-in-law to the said <hi>Haxstoun</hi> of <hi>Rathillet,</hi> that he is no Presbyterian, though an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Bishop upon the injury done to <hi>Haxstoun: Balfour</hi> himself and all that have conversed with him these seven years will disprove it, he having deserted the Church, and followed after Field-Conventicles all that time, and glorying to be reputed one of the most furious Zealots and stoutest Champions of the Phanatick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>party in <hi>Fife;</hi> for which he was denounced and intercommuned long before my Lord had any knowledge of, or intermeddling with <hi>Haxstoun</hi> his Brother-in-law. And for which, Captain <hi>Carstairs</hi> had received orders from the Privy Council to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the said <hi>Balfour.</hi> In pursuance whereof, Captain <hi>Carstairs,</hi> with his Servants, and one <hi>Garret</hi> an Englishman, for <hi>Scarlet</hi> the Tinker (known since to be one of <hi>Welch</hi>'s Guard) as he would never have assisted Captain <hi>Carstairs</hi> in any attempt against any of that Gang, so was he never reported or suspected by any of this Countrey to have been one of their number. Coming one day near by his House, resolved to make search for him there; It being known, he was no stranger to it (as is alledged) he was found with a company of armed Men feasting in his House, and upon <hi>Garrets</hi> alighting, fired his Pistol upon him, and thereafter breaking out of the House, overtook him before he could reach his Horse, knockt him down with their Swords, and left him not while by many fearful deadly Wounds, they thought they had murthered him, and then pursued Captain <hi>Carstairs</hi> most fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously, while being desperate of getting the like done with him, though they fired frequently at him, they retired. It is to be observed of this Scuffle, that it happened some four Months before <hi>Rathillet</hi>'s imprisonment, and consequently before it can be supposed <hi>Balfour</hi> should have suffered any thing from the Archbishop on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Brother-in-law <hi>Haxstoun.</hi> And further, that besides <hi>Balfour</hi> of <hi>Kinloch,</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:174874:7"/>there were others said to be present there, who are found to have been with him also at the Archbishops Murder.</p>
                  <p>For what is further said to have been the occasion of the execrable Murder, <hi>viz. The robbing and spoiling committed by Bailiff</hi> Carmichael, I leave it to all sober men to consider, whether the executing the Laws of the Land by a person cloathed with Commission from His Majesties Privy Council and the Principal Sheriff of the Shire conform to their Instructions, and a Warrand under His Majesties own hand deserves these Epithets: Only this must say that it can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that my Lord Archbishop had, out of his own mouth, ordered the Sheriff deputs to suspend the execution of their Sentence in poinding or distreining of Goods, six dayes before his murder.</p>
                  <p>As for what concerns the Murder it self, and the inhumane and barbarous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thereof, I hope you are sufficiently inabled to expose the defects and falshoods of this pretended true Relation, by the full Information you have thereof from my Lords own Daughter and his principal Servants, who to their inexpressible grief, were forced to be eye witnesses thereof. This account I chearfully give you, for your satisfaction, or whatever use you please; providing it be accepted as a part of the duty, that is and ever will be owing to the blessed memory of my dear Lord, by</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N the third of <hi>May,</hi> a day remarkable in the Church <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar,</hi> for the invention of the holy Cross, this excellent Prelate found his, and I hope obtained his Crown, (in which Moneth also, <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France,</hi> and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Beaton,</hi> one of his Predecessors, were assassinated) About nine of the Clock in the morning, he took his Coach in <hi>Kennoway,</hi> a Village ten Miles distant from St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> where he lay the night before, accompanied only with four of his own Servants, and his eldest Daughter in the Coach with him: about half an hour before he was attack't, his great Soul, it seems presaging what came to pass, he fell on a most serious and pious discourse to his Daughter, giving her such pious instructions and directions, as he would have done if upon his death-bed, whereunto she gave such becoming and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory answers, that he imbraced, and formally blessed her; afterward, coming near to a <hi>Farmor's</hi> House, called <hi>Magus,</hi> he said, there lives an ill natured-man, God preserve us my Child; within a very little time after, the Coach-man perceiving some Horse-men on the spur after them, calls to the Postilion to drive on, for those men had no good in their minds. My Lord finding the Coach run so hard, look't out to see what the matter was, and then perceiving armed men pursuing, he turning to his Daughter, said, Lord have mercy upon me my poor Child, for I am gone; upon which presently three or four of the Ruffians fired at the Coach, but touched neither of them in the Coach: the Coach-man put faster on, and outrun the most part of the Rogues, (my Lords own Servants, of which, the best armed was wounded in the head by a Sword, being mounted on weak Hackney Horses, had fallen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind before this, and were disarmed at the first coming up) while at last, one of the best mounted overhyed the Postilion, and by wounding him on
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:174874:8"/>the face, shooting the Coach-Horse which he led in the back, and cutting him in the Hams, turned the Coach out of the way, and gave the rest the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to come up; then they fired again, one of them had his Pistol so near my Lord, that the burning calfing was left on his Gown, and was rubbed off by his Daughter, which wounded him two or three inches below the right Clavicle, in betwixt the second and third Rib, and then another of them on the other side of the Coach run him upon the region of the Kidneys with a small Sword: thereafter they called, <hi>Come out cruel bloudy Traitor,</hi> but not any offered to lay hands upon, or drag him out of his Coach, as is falsly reported in the Relation; the Assassinats being all yet on Horse-back, whereupon, most composedly he opened the door of the Coach himself and stept out, and then said, Gentlemen, you will spare my life, and what ever else you please to do, ye shall never be questioned for it; they told him there was no mercy for a <hi>Judas,</hi> an enemy and Traitor to the Cause of Christ; well then, said he, I shall expect none from you, but promise to me to spare my poor Child, directing his Speech to one whom it is suspected by his look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him broad in the face, he knew, and reaching forth his hand to him, the bloody villain starts back from my Lord, and by a mighty blow, cut him more than half through the Wrist: then said my Lord, I hope ye will give me some time to pour out my Soul to God, and I shall also pray for you, and presently falling on his knees; he said, Lord forgive them, for I do: Lord receive my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: while thus praying on his knees, (one of the traitors standing some paces off, called to the rest, <hi>spare those gray Hairs</hi>) and his Hands lifted up, they struck furiously at them, and wounded him therein in three places, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless he kept up bleeding to Heaven, while one of them cut him to the Very bone, a little above the left eye, whereupon my Lord said; <hi>now you have done the turn;</hi> then falling fordward, he stretched himself out, and laid his Head on his Arm, as if he had been to compose himself for sleep, when some of the Villains from their Horses, and others afoot (having alighted) gave him about fifteen or sixteen wounds in the Head, and in effect, the whole Occipitial part was but one wound; after which, they riffled his Pockets, and took some Papers out of them; and so mad was their spigth and rage, that even after he was dead, and the Murderers gone some way from the body, one of the furious and bloody Assassins returned, and thrust twice or thrice at him with a Sword. They Robbed his Daughter of some Gold and other things she had in a little Box (they had wounded her, thrusting at her Father, betwixt whom and them she had interposed her self by a stabb in her Thigh, and one of her Thumbs) then they took away my Lords Night-bag, Bible, Girdle, and some Papers of moment, they also robbed his Servants, and took their Arms from them, and then went away as they came; and encountered one of my Lords Gentlemen, he had sent off some time before to salute the Earl of <hi>Crawford</hi> in his name, having passed near to his House; one of them cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to kill him, for he was one of <hi>Judas</hi> Servants, others came and took his Papers in his fore-pockets, and Arms, and bid him be gone, for his Master was gone home before him.

            <p>Thus fell that excellent Prelate (whose Character and worthy Acts deserve, and no doubt will find some excellent Pen) by the hands of nine Fanatick Ruffians. That they were so, is not to be doubted, their names being all now
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:174874:9"/>known, and all of them denunced, or intercommuned for frequenting field Conventicles, and the known Champions of that party in the Shire of <hi>Fife,</hi> besides their holy sanctified discourse at the time of their bloody actings, shews what temper and spirit they were of. I have done with my Relation, (attested to me before famous Witnesses, by my Lords Daughter, and these of his Servants that were so unfortunate to be spectators of this execrable villanny) when I have observed how ridiculous the Author of the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed true one is, where he indeavours to discover the occasion of the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Arch-bishop of St. <hi>Andrews;</hi> for, what need was there of any thing more to provoke them, than his being an Arch-bishop, and the Primat of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and the most active, as well as the most Reverend Father of this Church? was it not for this reason, that he was on the Streets of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> shot at by Mr. <hi>James Mitchel,</hi> while in his own Coach? was not this the reason, that these Fanatick Books from <hi>Holland,</hi> both sometime ago, and of late, marked out his <hi>Sacrum Caput,</hi> as they termed it, and devoted him to a cruel death, and gave out Predictions that he should die so? which they easily might, being so active in stimulating and prompting instruments to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil their own Prophecies.</p>
